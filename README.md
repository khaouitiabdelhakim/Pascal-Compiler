# Pascal Compiler (Lexical & Syntaxic) in C

This repository contains a minimalistic Pascal compiler implemented in C, covering lexical and syntax analysis. It serves as a learning resource for understanding the fundamental aspects of compiler design. The code is intentionally kept concise to provide a clear insight into the key stages of lexical and syntax analysis in a compiler.

## Features:
- Lexical analysis for Pascal language
- Syntax analysis for Pascal language
- Implemented in C for simplicity and clarity

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the source code using a C compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable with a Pascal source file as an argument.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance your understanding of compiler construction. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

Happy coding!
